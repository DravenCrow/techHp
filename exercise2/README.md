# Code Review and Refactoring Analysis

## What's wrong with the code?

- It does not check if req params and body are valid (shopId for req.params and email for req.body)
- Promise handling and callback nesting makes code very difficult to read
- Superagent post request possible error in callback is not handled
- If no 200 or 201 response from auth system, it will not fail, only propagate the response to the middleware and return OK. Is this desired behavior? Maybe fail if auth system returns anything different from 200 or 201?
- It will create the user in the database even before checking if the shop already exists
- Error in findOneAndUpdate callback is not handled
- It's failing with a 400 although the auth system is returning a 200 response. A 409 response code would be more appropriate than a 400 bad request, since the request is OK but the auth system indicates authorization is already processed
- Shop invitations indexOf is not checking if the invitation exists (not checking if it's -1) unlike shop.users.indexOf

## Potential Problems Leading to Exceptions

- Unhandled errors in callbacks
- Missing validation of request parameters
- No error handling for database operations
- Unchecked array operations could throw exceptions

## How to refactor the code

- Break down into smaller functions
- Use async/await instead of callbacks
- Add proper error handling
- Add input validation
- Add logging
